This is a [Sublime Text][sublime] package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing [KISSY][kissy] development.

## Installation ##

### With Package Control (Recommend) ###

If you have the [Package Control][package_control] package installed, you can install `KISSY Snippets` from inside Sublime Text itself. 

Open the **Command Palette** and select "**Package Control: Install Package**", then search for `KISSY` or `KISSY Snippets`.

It's just that simple!

### Without Package Control ###

If you haven't got Package Control installed (seriously, go install it!) you will need to make a clone of this repository into your sublime packages folder, like so:

	$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
    $ git clone https://github.com/zfkun/sublime-kissy-snippets.git KISSY
